          This project was an evaluation/ test of different kinds of models for
          the identification of pneumonia, trained on chest X-ray images.

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            In the data pre-processing section there was not enough data in the
            validation set. This problem was solved by splitting the entire
            training dataset into both training and validation, where 80% of the
            training set was used for the new training set, and the remaining
            20% was used for the validation set.
          </p>
          I used the method ‘stratify’ in order to maintain the ratio of
          positive to negative diagnosis results. The ratios have been presented
          in a visualisation to prove the ratios are staying consistent. The
          image size used for the images was 124X124. This is not only due to
          the ram requirements being too high for my machine when ran at
          224X224, but from research done on image size affecting model
          performance states that when using a dataset that Is smaller than an
          ‘ImageNet’ scale network can benefit from a smaller image size. Each
          model was run with the batch size of 32, for 25 epochs. The function
          ‘ReduceLROnPlateau’ was used when training the models in order to
          change the learning rates throughout training.
          <p>
            From the results collected the best performing model for Accuracy
            was ResNet152V2 after fine tuning, with an accuracy score of 88.6%
            For future work drawing parallels to the research reviewed in
            section one. Developing an algorithm which can localize specific
            parts of the lung that have been affected by pneumonia would be a
            great help to not only identify the diagnosis of pneumonia, but also
            can display the problem areas in urgent need of care.
