          I am a Computer Science graduate from Robert Gordon University with a
          passion for developing my understanding about programming and
          technology. I am motivated to advance and expand my skill set through
          targeted mentorship and challenging projects

          <p>
            As a computer science graduate, my experience at university was both
            challenging and rewarding. The coursework was rigorous and
            demanding, but also fascinating and inspiring. I was constantly
            learning new concepts, programming languages, and techniques, and
            applying them to real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            practical projects were particularly enjoyable because they allowed
            me to apply the knowledge and skills I had acquired in class to
            create something tangible and useful. Working on group projects also
            helped me develop my communication and collaboration skills, which
            are essential in the field of computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, my time at university was an invaluable experience that
            prepared me well for a career in computer science. I am grateful for
            the education, support, and mentorship I received during my studies
            and am excited to see where my career will take me next.
